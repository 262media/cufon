		<h2>Limitations</h2>
		
		<h3 id="blocky-edges">My font has blocky edges! How come?</h3>
		
		<p>There are limits to how accurately you can draw with a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, which cuf√≥n uses. Your font just happens to have curves that cannot be drawn so well. Changing the scaling options does not help.</p>
		
		<h3 id="note-ligature">Ligatures &amp; Digraphs</h3>
		
		<p>For now ligatures and digraphs are unsupported due to performance reasons. Support for them might be added in a future release but even then it would only be made available as an option that would be disabled by default.</p>

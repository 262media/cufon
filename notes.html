		<h2>Limitations</h2>
		
		<h3><a href="#browser-support" name="browser-support">Browser support</a></h3>
		
		<p>The following browers are supported:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Safari 2+ (note: need to verify 2.0)</li>
			<li>Firefox 1.5+ (note: need to verify 1.5)</li>
			<li>Opera 9+</li>
			<li>Internet Explorer 6+</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Additionally any standards-compliant browser with support for <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> should work just fine.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="#delays" name="delays">There's a delay before the text is replaced!</a></h3>
		
		<p>The most common causes are the following:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><strong>You have a slow-loading external <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag</strong>. This will prevent the DOMContentLoaded Event (and friends) from firing in time. Another option is to manually call <code>Cufon.DOM.ready()</code> without any arguments just before the other files. This will tell Cufon that the DOM is ready to be modified.</li>
			<li><strong>You are executing other JavaScript before calling <code>Cufon.replace()</code></strong>. Depending on what you're doing this might cause a delay. If possible, you should always call <code>Cufon.replace()</code> first and then do the rest of whatever you want to do.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3><a href="#blocky-edges" name="blocky-edges">My font has blocky edges! How come?</a></h3>
		
		<p>There are limits to how accurately you can draw with <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, which cuf√≥n uses. Your font just happens to have curves that cannot be drawn so well. Changing the scaling options rarely helps, but using a different font size might give slightly better results in some cases.</p>
		
		<h3><a href="#ligatures" name="ligatures">Ligatures &amp; Digraphs</a></h3>
		
		<p>For now ligatures and digraphs are unsupported due to performance reasons. Support for them might be added in a future release but even then it would only be made available as an option that would be disabled by default.</p>
